Introduction
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (Authority or BMA), the financial regulatory authority of
Bermuda through its Innovation Hub activities, invites proposals for a collaborative pilot project
aimed at testing Embedded Supervision practices within the context of Decentralised Finance
(DeFi). Recognising that DeFi’s rapid growth compels regulators to revisit traditional regulatory
principles to fulfil their public protection objectives, this pilot project aims to explore the potential
of embedded regulatory supervision1 within the technological framework of these projects for
embedded regulatory oversight, compliance, and automated reporting.
We welcome all stakeholders. including Digital Asset Businesses, Foundations, Protocols,
FinTech companies, DeFi operators, technology developers and academic institutions to apply for
this novel and unique initiative and contribute to shaping the future of regulatory supervision in
digital finance. The insights derived from this pilot will directly inform the evolution of BMA's
supervisory mechanisms in response to the rapidly evolving DeFi sphere.
1 “Embedded Supervision” refers to the direct integration of regulatory oversight, compliance checks, and reporting
mechanisms into the technological foundation of a financial platform—particularly within its smart contracts,
protocols, or data layers—so that supervisory requirements are inherently enforced in real-time with limited or
delayed human intervention.

Pilot Objectives:
1. Collaborative Understanding & Risk-Based Regulation
• Engage with industry participants to grasp the complexities of DeFi and inform adaptive,
risk-based regulatory frameworks
• Investigate the role of Embedded Supervision for projects with varying degrees of
decentralisation
• Examine decentralised governance models and explore mechanisms for effective
Embedded Supervision
2. Technical Feasibility & Operational Efficacy
• Determine which components of DeFi necessitate Embedded Supervision and how these
data elements should be relayed to regulators
• Assess the real-world outcomes of integrating embedded regulatory oversight, including
automated compliance checks and reporting
• Identify and address potential technological, data management, operational, security,
interoperability, and scalability challenges
3. Risk Monitoring & Development of Best Practices
• Monitor changes to DeFi risk parameters, evaluating stability and disclosure practices to
gauge the effectiveness of automated oversight
• Quantify efficiency gains resulting from real-time compliance monitoring and reporting
mechanisms
• Contribute to the establishment of best practices for implementing and maintaining
Embedded Supervision in DeFi platforms

Background and Context
DeFi presents an innovative, alternative financial services ecosystem deeply embedded in
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) intended to increase accessibility, transparency, and
efficiencies through disintermediation. An intrinsic part of DeFi applications is smart contracts,
peer-to-peer networks, and protocols that collectively work towards achieving these objectives.
With its pace of evolution and inherent ethos, DeFi invokes key considerations for regulators. For
instance:
1. Lack of Central Authority: DeFi's decentralised nature complicates the implementation
of centralized oversight measures. Determining responsibility for regulatory outcomes or
executing corrective actions in such a distributed system requires innovative thinking.
2. AML/KYC Challenges: DeFi’s pseudonymous nature may require novel Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes. Ensuring that illicit
activities are effectively monitored, identified, and prevented requires effective approaches
and potentially revised regulatory frameworks.
3. Technological Complexity: Regulatory adaptation to DeFi's rapidly changing,
technologically robust models can prove challenging. Skills enhancement and regulatory
agility are of crucial importance.
4. Cross-border Transactions: DeFi's borderless nature means that it operates globally via
the internet, complicating jurisdictional authority and the applicability of a particular
country's laws and regulatory frameworks.
5. Rapid Evolution: DeFi's agile pace of innovation presents difficulties for traditional
regulatory reviews, necessitating a proactive and adaptive approach to oversight.
6. Parameter of Decentralization: Recognising the degree of decentralisation in a
particular DeFi model is vital. Some platforms may claim complete decentralisation, but
in practice, a limited group of stakeholders (developers, miners, etc.) may exert
significant influence.
To devise an effective regulatory approach to these models, it is fundamental to understand the
specific challenges that DeFi solutions present, the associated risks, and the necessary and
appropriate mode of regulatory intervention. The initiative to pilot the Embedded Supervision
approach with industry participation – particularly DeFi operators, is a significant step towards
navigating these challenges.
Traditional methods of regulatory oversight face unique difficulties in this environment, making
it necessary to craft innovative regulatory approaches tailored to DeFi and increasingly
decentralised applications. The Embedded Supervision model offers an innovative method to
achieve this objective and forms the basis for this call for proposals.

PUBLIC
Embedded Supervision refers to a regulatory oversight mechanism that incorporates automated
compliance and reporting built atop an underlying technological infrastructure. At its core,
Embedded Supervision aims to integrate regulatory requirements within supervised institution's
systems for real-time and efficient compliance monitoring. The BMA believes that piloting
Embedded Supervision could be instrumental in enhancing regulatory practices for projects in the
realm of DeFi.
Example Pilot Projects
Potential pilot participants are encouraged to think creatively and propose innovative pilot tests
for the BMA's Embedded Supervision initiative. The following examples may serve as inspiration:
1. Regulatory DAO Implementation: This pilot project could involve creating a
Regulatory Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) on a DeFi network, with
Embedded Supervision incorporating the BMA as a non-voting member. It could assess
the DAO's capability in enforcing real-time regulatory decisions and maintaining
compliance.
2. DeFi Lending Platform Supervision: Evaluate Embedded Supervision within a DeFi
lending platform with specified risk parameters and the disclosure practices for any
changes to the project.
3. Smart Contract-Driven Regulatory Compliance: This pilot project could investigate the
feasibility of integrating key regulatory requirements (including licence conditions) into
the smart contracts that underpin a DeFi platform.
4. Real-Time Compliance Reporting System: This pilot project could explore developing
and implementing a real-time compliance reporting system in a DeFi platform. The
system would be designed to automatically collect necessary data and produce
compliance reports in real-time, allowing for immediate detection and rectification of any
regulatory breaches.
5. Collateral Management Supervision: Explore implementing Embedded Supervision to
monitor the collateral levels for issued stablecoins continuously. Automated alerts could
be triggered if collateral thresholds defined by regulatory guidelines are breached.
6. Regulatory Node Implementation on DeFi protocols: Develop a proof-of-concept for
BMA's direct involvement in public blockchain networks by setting up regulatory nodes
for direct and real-time oversight.

Proposal Submission Guidelines
The project proposals should provide a comprehensive overview of the proposed pilot and include
the following key elements:
1. Executive Summary: A brief introduction outlining the project's purpose, objectives,
collaboration with the BMA, and potential impact in relation to the DeFi environment and
the BMA's Embedded Supervision initiative.
2. Project Description and Objectives: A detailed explanation of the proposed pilot project,
including its specific objectives, the problems it aims to solve, the expected outcomes, and
the role and function of the BMA.
3. Methodology: A thorough description of the methodologies to be used. Include
information about the process, tools, and technologies that will be used.
